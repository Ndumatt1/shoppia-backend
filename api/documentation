# This file contains basic documentation on how to run the backend code without issue

# To install all the dependencies for the backend run - npm install
NOTE: You must have node and npm installed and make sure you are running the command in the root directory where package.json file is located
# Setup a mysql database
The backend uses mysql as its database, setup a database before starting the server to persist data created.

# Start the server
#To start the server run - npm start

# For the jwt secret key create a .env file in the root directory and create a key value pair and assign a value of your choice to the key.
NOTE: make sure the key matches the key used in the code e.g JWT_SECRET=... should be the key name to match the codes where it appears
# Set up mysql database and assign the user, database name and password in the .env file
NOTE: make sure the key names match the ones used in the code e.g DB_PASSWORD should be assigned password, DB should be assigned the database name and USER should be assigned the user(it takes a default user root if no user was set in the .env file), the HOST value if not set uses the default localhost as host.

# Start the server
To start the server run - npm start


TAKE NOTE: All enpoint uses pagination so you are required to add page and limit to the query
EXAMPLE: http://localhost:5000/api/v1/products?page=1&limit=20 This will fetch 20 products from the first page
